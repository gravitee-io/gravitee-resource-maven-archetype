Maven Archetype to create a Gravitee Resource

== Get started

A Resource is a step in the Request/Response Gateway proxy chain. A Resource acts as a *proxy controller* by guaranteeing if a given business rule is fulfilled during the Request/Response processing.

Archetype is already registered into the http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html[OSS repositories]. Don't forget to activate them in your Maven settings.

== Resource generation

Suppose you want to create a Resource that control if request contains the ``X-Foo`` header. Let's name it the *Foo header check resource*. Then you could generate your Resource like this:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate\
 -DarchetypeGroupId=io.gravitee.maven.archetypes\
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=gravitee-resource-maven-archetype\
 -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0\
 -DartifactId=foo-header-check-resource\
 -DgroupId=my.gravitee.extension.resource\
 -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\
 -DresourceName=FooHeaderCheck
```

Once executed and parameters confirmed, the above command will create the ``foo-header-check-resource`` directory containing the following structure:

```
.
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── assembly
    │   └── resource-assembly.xml
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   │   └── my
    │   │       └── gravitee
    │   │           └── extension
    │   │               └── resource
    │   │                   ├── FooHeaderCheckResourceConfiguration.java
    │   │                   └── FooHeaderCheckResource.java
    │   └── resources
    │       └── plugin.properties
    └── test
        └── java
            └── my
                └── gravitee
                    └── extension
                        └── resource
                            └── FooHeaderCheckResourceTest.java
```

Hereafter a description about the different generated files:

|===
| File    | Description |

| pom.xml | The main Maven POM file        |
| README.md | The main entry point for documentation of the Resource      |
| resource-assembly.xml | The common Maven assembly descriptor for any Policies |
| FooHeaderCheckResourceConfiguration.java | The Resource configuration class |
| FooHeaderCheckResource.java | The Resource class, from which the business behavior is implemented |
| plugin.properties | The Resource descriptor file |
| FooHeaderCheckResourceTest.java | The Resource unit test Java class |
|===

=== pom.xml

Each Resource (and more generally any Gravitee projects) is https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] managed. Thus, a Resource project is described by using the Maven https://maven.apache.org/pom.html[Project Object Model] file.

=== README.md

Each Resource should have a dedicated `README.md` file to document it. The `README.md` file should contain everything related to the use of your Resource: *What is its functionality? How can use it? How can configure it?*

=== resource-assembly.xml

A Resource is just a kind of Gravitee Plugin.

It  can be plugged to the [Gravitee Gateway](https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-gateway) by using the distribution file built from the `resource-assembly.xml` file.

Based on our *FooHeaderCheck* Resource, the distribution file structure is the following:

```
.
├── foo-header-check-resource-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
├── lib
└── schemas
    └── urn:jsonschema:my:gravitee:extension:resource:FooHeaderCheckResourceConfiguration.json
```

Hereafter a description about the different generated files:

| File    | Description | 
|---------|-------------|
| `foo-header-check-resource-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` | The main Resource jar file         |
| `lib/` | Where the external dependencies are stored (from the [Maven POM file dependencies](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html)          |
| `schemas/` | Where the JSON configuration schemas are stored          |

==== JSON Configuration schemas

Resource configuration is described inside one or several http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/[Java Bean] classes (see the FooHeaderCheckResourceConfiguration.java example).

During the packaging phase, each Resource configuration classes are processed to generate one or several http://json-schema.org/[JSON schema(s)] that will be read by the Gateway when the Resource will be plugged in.

JSON schema generation is done thanks to the Gravitee's https://github.com/gravitee-io/json-schema-generator-maven-plugin[json-schema-generator-maven-plugin] Maven plugin.

=== FooHeaderCheckResourceConfiguration.java

The Resource configuration class.

Resource configuration is described into one or several http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/[Java Bean] class(es) where each attribute is a configuration parameter.

During the package phase, Resource configuration is compiled into JSON Configuration schemas. These schemas are used to parse https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-gateway[API definitions].

Resource configuration is finally injected to the Resource class instance at runtime and then can be used during implementation.

=== FooHeaderCheckResource.java

The main Resource class. Contains business code that implements the Resource.

=== plugin.properties

As said, a Resource is a kind of Gravitee Plugin.

Each Plugin is described by the *plugin.properties* descriptor which declare the following parameters:

|===
| Parameter   | Description | Default value |

| `id` | The Resource identifier     | Resource artifact id |
| `name` | The Resource name     | N/A (mandatory parameter) |
| `version` | The Resource version     | N/A (mandatory parameter) |
| `description` | The Resource description     | "Description of the *Resource name* Gravitee Resource" |
| `class` | The main Resource class     | Path to the generated class file |
| `type` | The type of Gravitee Plugin     | `resource` |
|===

> A Resource is enabled when declared into the API definition. To do so, the Resource identifier is used to, as its name indicate, identify the Resource. Thus, **be ware to correctly choose the Resource identifier** from the beginning. It could be hard to rename it later if there are many of API definitions linked to it.

=== FooHeaderCheckResourceTest.java
 
The http://junit.org/[JUnit] unit test class for this Resource.

== Tip

Choose a short but clearly name for your Resource, **without precise the Resource suffix**. The `gravitee-resource-maven-archetype` will add it automatically.

For example, **do not** fill the ``resourceName`` of your Resource like this:

```
-DresourceName=AmazingStuffResource
```

but like this:

```
-DresourceName=AmazingStuff
```
